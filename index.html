              __NAME__ studied advanced mathematics and was described by professors as "__NAME__ was some kind of really new genius" and "__NAME__ was one of the most remarkably bright mathematics students ever at WVU." Because of this mathematical skill, he could potentially be seen as fitting the

              __NAME__ developed ATM banking software, financial transaction software, invested in the financial cryptography startup CertCo, worked on ANSI X9 standards, and was indirectly involved in startups like InternetCash.com and CyberCash. This experience shows a familiarity with the same

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        Should Satoshi’s identity ever be revealed? Some believe it must remain secret, to protect privacy, decentralization, legal safety, and the stability of the network. Others argue that disclosure is important, for historical accuracy, transparency, public interest, and to prevent misuse of
        the name. I struggled with this doubt, weighing the importance of truth against the possible consequences of exposure.
      </p>

      <p>
        While doing research I'm convinced that __FULLNAME__ COULD be the man behind Satoshi Nakamoto. But I want to make it absolutely clear that it's my personal observation and certainly not an accusation. There is no waterproof evidence, not confirmation. Please do not treat everything on this
        website as fact but as one perspective meant for discussion and exploration. Everyone is encouraged to conduct their own independent research.
      </p>

      <p>
        I decided to share my findings, carefully documented and sourced. If future research shows that __FULLNAME__ is not (linked to) Satoshi, I offer my sincere apologies. Even then, I hope this website can stand as a tribute to his remarkable contributions and impact on the world of security and
        cryptography. One thing is sure: __FULLNAME__’s contributions, inventions, and investments in early cryptography companies laid important groundwork for the later success of Bitcoin!

        <h2>Reaction</h2>
        <p>I’ve attempted to reach out to __FULLNAME__ a few times but haven’t succeeded. Should __NAME__ wish to provide an official statement, I would be more than happy to publish it here, ensuring his perspective is fully represented.</p>
